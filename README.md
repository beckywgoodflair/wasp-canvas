Feel free to cut your own branch off of Master to develop in parallel! No need to worry about a mistake as you can always get a clean copy from here! That's the beauty of version control babyyyy!!! Instructions on how to do this will be provided during the 1st lesson and left up in a VOD for those unable to make it.

Happy coding!
